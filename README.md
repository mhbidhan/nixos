# NixOS Configuration

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration, built on top of [Hydenix](https://github.com/richen604/hydenix). It is tailored specifically to my workflow and personal taste.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Note:** This configuration is maintained solely for my own use; feel free to explore or fork it, but expect no active support or maintenance.

If you are looking for a more general-purpose starting point, I highly recommend checking out [Hydenix](https://github.com/richen604/hydenix) or the [HyDE Project](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) for Arch/NixOS.
